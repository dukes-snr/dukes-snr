# Hi there, I'm Dukes Davis. 👋

<!-- ![Banner](https://yourdomain.com/path-to-your-banner-image.png) -->

I'm a passionate developer, designer, and lifelong learner. I love building creative solutions and exploring new technologies. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring design, photography, or enjoying a cup of coffee at my local café.
